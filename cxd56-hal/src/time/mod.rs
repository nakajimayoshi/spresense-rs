//! Async time via the embassy [`Driver`](embassy_time_driver::Driver) trait: a
//! hardware timer plus an [`embassy_time_queue_utils`] software queue, so an
//! arbitrary number of `embassy_time::Timer`s can be in flight at once — unlike the
//! single-in-flight [`async_delay`](crate::async_delay).
//!
//! # Backing (`time-driver-*` feature)
//!
//! Enable **exactly one**:
//!
//! * **`time-driver-rtc`** (default) — RTC0 alarm 0. Perf-invariant, always-on,
//!   32.768 kHz; the 47-bit counter *is* the monotonic `now()`, 1:1 with
//!   `tick-hz-32_768` (no rescale, no overflow handling), ~30.5 µs granularity. The
//!   safe default and right for low-power work.
//! * **`time-driver-timer`** — SP804 `TIMER0`/`TIMER1`. `TIMER0` free-runs as the
//!   monotonic base, a software *period* counter extends it across 32-bit wraps;
//!   `TIMER1` is the one-shot alarm (the SP804 has no compare register, so a
//!   continuous `now()` plus an arbitrary alarm needs both halves). The SP804 counts
//!   the **perf-dependent** CPU base clock, so `now()`/alarms are software-rescaled
//!   to `tick-hz-1_000_000` (~1 µs). [`init`] must sample the base clock first, and
//!   the operating point must not change while the driver is live.
//!
//! # App wiring
//!
//! 1. Depend on `embassy-time` with the matching `tick-hz-*` and a `generic-queue-N`
//!    (and an executor **without** `integrated-timers`).
//! 2. Call [`init`] once after clock/perf setup.
//! 3. Forward the backing's interrupt vector(s) — the library cannot define them
//!    (the PAC weakly binds them to `DefaultHandler`), so the app owns the handler:
//!    * rtc: `RTC0_A0` → [`on_interrupt`].
//!    * timer: `TIMER0` → [`on_overflow_interrupt`], `TIMER1` → [`on_alarm_interrupt`].
//!
//! Without the forwarder(s) an alarm fires into `DefaultHandler` and timers never
//! complete (the same contract as [`crate::gpio`]'s `Wait` and [`crate::async_delay`]).
