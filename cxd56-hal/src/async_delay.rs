//! Async one-shot tick delay backed by a hardware timer.
//!
//! This is the HAL's interrupt-driven async time source: a future that arms a
//! hardware compare/alarm, suspends, and is woken by that peripheral's interrupt
//! — so the core can `WFE`-sleep (and the executor run other tasks) for the whole
//! delay instead of busy-spinning a counter.
//!
//! # Swappable backing (`TickSource`)
//!
//! The timing peripheral sits behind the private [`TickSource`] seam and is
//! selected by a Cargo feature, mirroring embassy's `time-driver-*` convention.
//! Enable **exactly one**:
//!
//! * **`async-delay-rtc`** (default) — RTC0 **alarm channel 0**. The RTC runs at a
//!   fixed 32.768 kHz and is **perf-invariant and always-on**, so a delay is the
//!   same real time at every operating point and survives a clock change. Tick
//!   granularity is ~30.5 µs. This is the right default for low-power work, and it
//!   needs no clock setup.
//! * **`async-delay-timer`** — SP804 **`TIMER0`** (see [`crate::timer`]) in
//!   one-shot mode. It counts at the CPU/AHB base clock, so the resolution is
//!   sub-µs (≈6.4 ns/tick at HP) but the rate is **perf-dependent**: the backing
//!   must sample the base clock before first use via [`init`] or [`Delay::new`],
//!   and the operating point must not change while a delay is in flight (the same
//!   constraint [`Timer`](crate::timer::Timer) enforces with its `Clock` borrow).
//!
//! Both implement the same [`TickSource`]; nothing above the seam — the public
//! API, the GPIO edge-arm settle — changes between them. A delay is always
//! requested in real time ([`after_micros`] / the [`DelayNs`] impl); only the raw
//! [`after_ticks`] escape hatch is in source-specific ticks.
//!
//! # The app must forward the source interrupt
//!
//! Like the GPIO [`Wait`](crate::gpio::Wait) API, a library cannot define the
//! interrupt vector itself (the PAC weakly binds it to `DefaultHandler`), so the
//! application owns the handler and forwards it to [`on_interrupt`]. The vector is
//! the active backing's: **`RTC0_A0`** (rtc) or **`TIMER0`** (timer):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[interrupt]
//! fn RTC0_A0() { // or `TIMER0` with `async-delay-timer`
//!     cxd56_hal::async_delay::on_interrupt(cxd56_hal::pac::Interrupt::RTC0_A0);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is required by anything that awaits a delay here — including the GPIO
//! edge-arm baseline settle (`wait_for_*_edge`, see [`crate::gpio`]). Without the
//! handler the alarm fires into `DefaultHandler` and the delay never completes.
//!
//! # Concurrency (v1)
//!
//! A single delay may be in flight at a time (one alarm channel, one waker). That
//! covers the edge-arm settle and simple apps; a multi-waiter deadline queue (or
//! the RTC's other two channels) is a future extension behind the same seam.
